data_prep_test.r: combines TCGA_STAD data and merges. The code includes J's for the sake of simplicity while I test different gene sets
ssgsea_test.r: scores RNAseq data by gene set using single sample gsea analysis. Might include in implimentation as an alternative to singscore
Note: Will split data_prep_test as I test different metrics and create visualizations for clustering
